**About Me**  
I'm a passionate learner deeply interested in the world of **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning**, and **Data Analytics**. Currently a student, I spend most of my time working on hands-on projects that explore data, build intelligent models, and draw meaningful insights.

I enjoy turning complex data into stories and using algorithms to solve real-world problems. Whether it's building a predictive model, cleaning messy data, or visualizing insightsâ€”I'm always up for the challenge.
